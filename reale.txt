Real Estate :-
           One of the key ways investors can make money in real estate is to become a landlord of a rental property.
           Flippers buy undervalued real estate, fix it up, and sell for a profit.
           Real estate investment trusts (REITs) provide real estate exposure without the need to own, operate or 
           finance properties.


Benifits of Real Estate :-
          1.Diversification and Protection : Addition of Real Estate in your portfolio can lower its volatility and
            provide a higher return per unit of risk .
          2.Inflation Hedging : As economies(GDP) expand, the demand for real estate drives rents higher, and this
            in turn, translates into higher capital values .
