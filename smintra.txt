     • Intraday(Daily) Trading : 
               Intraday trading involves buying and selling stocks within the same trading day. Here stocks are purchased, 
               not to invest, but to earn profits by harnessing the movement of stock indices. Thus, the fluctuations in the 
               prices of the shares are monitored to earn profits from the trading of stocks.
 
       Benifits of Intraday trading :
               1.Allowed to buy shares on margin
               2.Allowed to short sell
               3.Low Brokerage
     
     
     • Swing Trading : 
               Swing trading is a style of trading that attempts to capture short to medium term gains in a stock
               (or any financial instrument) over a period of a few days to several weeks.
               Swing traders primarily use technical analysis to look for trading opportunities.
     
       Benifits of Swing trading 
               1.It maximizes short-term profit potential by capturing the bulk of market swings.

Calculation for Trading :
       For Intraday , lets assume a share is at price of 100 at time 10 am , at 11:30 an it becomes 101.2 .
       The gain is 101.2 - 100 = 1.2 .So if you have 50 shares it will be 1.2 * 50 = 60 .
